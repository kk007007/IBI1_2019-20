Reflective reprot
Now is near the ending of semester two and i have finished all the practical in IBI1. It is a good time to reflect all the practical i had done and contribute to future study. In formative portfolio, the feedback said that the pseudocode was weak and i did not explain things clearly. And in the subsequent practical, I wrote detailed pseudocode to help myself understand the code better. Also, I learnt from the experience of programming that when i encountered a problem, i shoud first think rigorously instead of quickly start programming. In addition, i learned how to search information and how to ask good questions. And communicate with classmates made the process of programming smmoth.
Througn the practical, I understand basic code in python and basic algorithm (e.g. recursion), and i will keep studying to enhance my programming!
